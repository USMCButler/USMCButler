- 👋 Hi, I’m @USMCButler
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things and then trying them for myself. I believe that no matter what your age, learning at least one new thing a day, will keep the doctor away. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about this website and what github is and has to offer. Im also currently getting my masters degree in Public health and sciences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. Im still new to this but I'm up for anything. It may take some time for me to fully grasp, but once I understand it to its fullest, watch out.! Theres no slowing me down.!!
- 📫 How to reach me by email preferably. My email is; usmcbutler1775@gmail.com
